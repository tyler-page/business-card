# Personal Business Card

I created a Business Card on Scrimba as part of my @CodeYourFuture Intro To Digital course I am doing. 

It is a basic card to pass the test but with more knowledge over time I will be able to edit and add/remove detail to make it much better as i progress in my coding learning.
